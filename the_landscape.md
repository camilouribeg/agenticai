Hereâ€™s a comparison between *AutoGen* and *CrewAI*:
- Flexibility vs. User-Friendliness: AutoGen provides more flexibility and control for advanced developers, while CrewAI offers a structured approach suitable for business users.
- Workflow Suitability: CrewAI is suited for structured, role-based research workflows, whereas AutoGen excels at adaptive, evolving prompts.
- Dynamic Feedback: AutoGen can self-correct code errors through iterative learning, while CrewAI lacks this dynamic feedback loop.
- Unique Features: CrewAI has a modular design and task delegation between agents, while AutoGen supports containerized code execution for safety.
